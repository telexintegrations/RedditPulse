# Reddit Pulse

## Introduction

This project is a social monitoring tool integrated with the telex platform. It fetches popular reddit posts hourly and sends a notification when specific topics that have been selected trend. It leverages FastAPI to create a robust API for handling requests and integrates with Reddit to fetch trending posts based on specified keywords.

## Features

- **Reddit API Integration**: Fetches trending Reddit posts based on keywords and sends notifications to a specified return URL.
- **Configuration Management**: Utilizes Pydantic for defining application settings, including project name, version, and Reddit API credentials.
